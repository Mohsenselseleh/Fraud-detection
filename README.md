# Fraud-detection
# ðŸ§  Fraud Detection in Python

This repository contains a complete end-to-end project on fraud detection using machine learning, built as part of a course-style learning experience.

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `Complete_Fraud_Detection_Notebook.ipynb`  
  A structured Jupyter notebook that walks through every phase of a fraud detection pipeline, including model building, evaluation, interpretation, and cost-sensitive decision making.

- `app.py`  
  A Streamlit app that allows users to interactively adjust the fraud detection threshold and observe the impact on total fraud cost.

## ðŸš€ Notebook Overview

The notebook covers the following sections:

### ðŸ”¹ Section 1â€“2: Data Preparation & Imbalance Handling
- Simulated fraud transaction dataset
- Class imbalance analysis
- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)

### ðŸ”¹ Section 3: Model Training
- Logistic Regression
- XGBoost Classifier

### ðŸ”¹ Section 4: Performance Metrics
- Confusion matrix
- ROC and Precision-Recall Curves
- Accuracy Paradox explanation

### ðŸ”¹ Section 5: Optimal Threshold Selection
- Custom cost function for fraud vs. false alarm
- Threshold vs. cost simulation

### ðŸ”¹ Section 6: Model Interpretability
- SHAP explanations for XGBoost
- Coefficients and odds ratios for Logistic Regression
